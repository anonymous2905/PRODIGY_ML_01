Prodigy Infotech Task-1

House Price Prediction
This Python script demonstrates a simple linear regression model for predicting house prices using the scikit-learn library. It loads a dataset containing various features of houses (such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, living area square footage, etc.) along with their prices, trains a linear regression model on the training data, and evaluates its performance using mean squared error and R-squared metrics.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You'll also need to install the following libraries:

pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn


Usage

The dataset used in this project is stored in a CSV file named data.csv. It contains various features of houses (such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, living area square footage, etc.) along with their corresponding prices.

Model Evaluation

The script evaluates the performance of the linear regression model using two metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)
R-squared (R2)


Mean Squared Error
R-squared
Additionally, it generates two plots:

Actual Prices vs. Predicted Prices
Residual Plot
